Spotify is a popular music streaming service that offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and other audio content. If
you have a Spotify subscription, you can share it with friends and family members so they can enjoy the benefits of
premium features like ad-free listening, offline playback, and more. In this article, we'll show you how to share your
Spotify subscription with others.

## How to share your Spotify subscription

To share your Spotify subscription with friends and family, you can create a Spotify Family plan. The Spotify Family
plan
allows you to add up to six people to your subscription, each with their own account and personalized playlists. Here's
how to set up a Spotify Family plan:

1. **Sign up for a Spotify Premium Family plan**: If you don't already have a Spotify Premium Family plan, you can sign
   up for one on the Spotify website. The Family plan costs $14.99 per month and allows you to add up to six people to
   your subscription.
2. **Invite family members**: Once you have signed up for the Family plan, you can invite family members to join your
   subscription. To do this, go to your account settings on the Spotify website and click on the "Family" tab. From
   there,
   you can send invitations to family members via email or by sharing a link.
3. **Accept the invitation**: Family members who receive an invitation to join your Spotify Family plan will need to
   accept the invitation in order to join the subscription. They can do this by clicking on the link in the invitation
   email or by logging in to their Spotify account and accepting the invitation there.
4. **Enjoy premium features**: Once family members have accepted the invitation and joined your Spotify Family plan,
   they
   will have access to all the premium features of Spotify, including ad-free listening, offline playback, and more.
5. **Manage your subscription**: As the owner of the Spotify Family plan, you can manage your subscription and family
   members from your account settings on the Spotify website. You can add or remove family members, change payment
   methods, and more.

By following these steps, you can easily share your Spotify subscription with friends and family members, allowing
everyone to enjoy the benefits of premium features like ad-free listening and offline playback. If you have any
questions about setting up a Spotify Family plan or sharing your subscription, you can contact Spotify support for

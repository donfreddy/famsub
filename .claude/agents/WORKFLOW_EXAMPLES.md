# 4. Implementation
"Implement the caching strategy recommended by performance-auditor"

# 5. Testing
"Have test-engineer create performance tests to verify improvements"

# 6. Monitoring Setup
"Use project-architect to add performance monitoring"
```

## 🛡️ Security Incident Response Workflow

## 🔗 Agent Chaining Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Analysis

```
code-auditor → security-auditor → performance-auditor → test-engineer
```

Use when: Doing comprehensive code review

### Pattern 2: Parallel Analysis

```
        ┌→ security-auditor    ─┐
Issue ──┼→ performance-auditor  ├→ Report
        └→ architecture-auditor ┘
```

Use when: Investigating complex problems

### Pattern 3: Iterative Improvement

```
code-auditor → Fix Issues → code-auditor → test-engineer → release-manager
```

Use when: Ensuring high code quality

### Pattern 4: Strategic to Tactical

```
strategic-analyst → project-architect → integration-manager → development
```

Use when: Planning new features or projects

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: When reviewing multiple modules, invoke all auditors at once
2. **Context Sharing**: Mention findings from one agent when invoking another
3. **Explicit Chaining**: Tell Claude to use specific agents in sequence
4. **Parallel Execution**: Request multiple agents for faster results

## 🎪 Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Project Coordination

```bash
"Use strategic-analyst to plan the API versioning strategy across our 5 microservices, 
then have project-architect create a consistent structure for each service, 
and finally use integration-manager to create coordinated Linear tasks for all teams"
```

### Continuous Quality Monitoring

```bash
"Set up a workflow where code-auditor reviews every PR, 
test-engineer ensures test coverage doesn't drop, 
and release-manager maintains a rolling changelog"
```

### Architecture Evolution

```bash
"Have architecture-auditor analyze our system monthly, 
strategic-analyst model the impact of suggested changes, 
and project-architect implement approved improvements"
```

Remember: Agents work best when given clear, specific objectives. Combine their expertise to tackle complex challenges
efficiently.
